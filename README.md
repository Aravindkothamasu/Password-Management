# Password-Management
Using LPC2148 (ARM7) implementation of Password-Management,by interfacing LCD,UART,GSM,4*4 Keypad.



                                  Project Name : Password Management Using LPC2148 (ARM7)
                              ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Programming Language :    Cpp,
  --------------------
  Protocols Used : UART,I2C,SPI,
  ---------------
  Sensors Interface : LCD, GSM, 4*4 Keypad,
  ------------------
  
  Firstly we have to SET a Password from user through keypad,and enter the date of birth and to conform it through GSM enter OTP ,
  after entering OTP,if it success store in memory and next main menu will display,indicates that
  1,Reset Password
  2,Enter Password
  
  
  In Reset Password
  ------------------
       . Firstly Enter OTP generated by random function and you to enter OTP through 4*4 keyp You to confirm OTP
       . if both are matched ,then Enter new Password and that should not match with the Previously entered passwords
       . Only 4 Passwords You can save.
       . If all sucessfully done ,enter login screen.
   
   
   
 In Enter Password
 ------------------
        . In enter password ,newly entered password should password enter 
        . If it correct, login screen will appear.
      
      
      
Creation of Project
-------------------
        . Through Keil 4 or Keil 5 create a project with selecting microcontroller LPC2148 and donot add startup code and all these files and compile and create a executable file.
